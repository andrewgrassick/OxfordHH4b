At this point we are very confident both with the signal sample generation
(that has been redone from scratch by Nathan with consistent cuts and settings
for all the processes, and now it includes as well hadronic ttbar) and the
b-tagging implementation, both in the resolved and in the boosted regime. We
understand for example why the 2b2j can be comparable to the 4b, and why the
naive expectation is not a very good estimate.

So now we think that this is the time to run the various analysis, to get the
global picture of where we are and where do we need to improve. This includes
both the resolved and the boosted regimes, as well as the ANN-based analysis.
In the latter case, we agreed to run both a traditional cut-based substructure
analysis and also the ANN multivariate analysis, so that we can cross-check
the results of the latter.

In this respect, a paper that appeared this week concerning ANN-tagging for
boosted tops can be relevant for us
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05968

We also discussed how to combine the various regimes (boosted, resolved,
intermediate) and here the technique of scale-invariant tagging of my paper
with Gavin should be useful.

Once we have the full analysis, including the cut-flows, with the different
strategies, we can discuss how do we want to proceed next.
