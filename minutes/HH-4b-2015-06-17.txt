Minutes HH->4b meeting 2015/06/17
*********************************

- Agreed to keep symmetric cut in pt_subjet, and to add to the MVA the pt of the subjets
for the boosted and resolved categories

- Nathan's results indicate that adding the ECF in the MVA helps quite a bit
in improving the signal significance

- Need to compute how many signal events we are left with as a function of the
cut in the MVA output, for the three categories

- Try to add separately C2 and D2 in the MVA, on top of their ratio C2/D2

- Thanks to the new substructure variables, the signal significance is
now S/sqrt(B) \sim 2.5 already in the boosted case, adding up to almost 3 if we add
the significance of the other categories

- Nathan will recompute the numbers including only the 4b background

- Agreed to implement the mistag rate for c jets

- Create in the repo a folder with the data files for the final analysis
and the corresponding python scripts, to be able to create the plots
we need easily for the paper

- Check what happens if the b-tagging is varied from 70% to 90%. Same
for the fake rejection rate and the mass resolution

- Include effects of the systematic uncertainty in the number of background
events expected, and see how signifiance changes when varying this assumption
