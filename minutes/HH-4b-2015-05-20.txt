- Understood effect of cut in pt_jet > 40 GeV,
reducing jet multiplicity, but this is perfectly fine,
the b-tagging is working fine.

- Why there are selected fat jets without selected subjets?
This is now understood, since track jets were defined for
charged particles at the level of quarks and gluons, which
is unphysical: charged and neutral particles are only
defined after hadronization

- Default strategy is look only at the two hardest subjets
of each fat jet and try to b-tag them, but we will also try
to see what happens if we try to b tag all the subjets
in a fat jet (conjecture is that discrimination will decrease)

- Current best option is boosted case, we get S/sqrt(B) = 1.1,
before the MVA

- Agreed to run in the background the samples with
hadronization.
Most likely we need to do this only for the backgrounds
that are relevant after selection cuts and MVA.
Nathan will take care of this.

- Investigate subjet pt distribution, see which is the optimal value of
the pt cut (some preference for largish value)

- Add also stat errors to the S/sqrt(B) macro

- All numbers shown from Katherina are with unweighted events,
We need to check the statistics, and cross-check
using Nathan's reweighted code

- Add also number of signal events, and background events
So the tables should contain: S, B, S/B, S/sqrt(B), and
with the corresponding statistical uncertainties.

- Nathan has run MVA on a combined event sample
-> boosted+resolved+intermediate
Input as MVA -> Reconstructed Higgs quantities only
We find that signal and background are not incredibly well separated,
and thus the discrimination power of the MVA is reduced (30%
improvement)

- It is interesting to see what we can get out of the di-Higgs system,
even without looking at the substructure details.

- Probably better to train separately for the three independent categories

- Point out the crucial important on the jet mass resolution,
as well as in the jet pt resolution, to improve significance

- Angular variables do help a bit

- Add plot of correlations between different variables
Perhaps even include correlations between variables

- Add distributions for all variables in the backup
for the signal and background, for everything that enters
the MVA

- MVA does better in the purely resolved case.
We end up with S/sqrt(B) = 1.1, a factor 2 in improvement
as compared to no MVA

- Training of the MVA on all samples degrades the discrimination

- Writing of the paper
We need first of all to finalize the analysis strategy, hopefully
by next week


* Action plan
-------------

1) With the current analysis set-up, run the analysis non-exclusively.
This generated three categories: boosted, resolved and
intermediate, which are non-exclusive (so they overlap)

2) Train the MVA separately in each of these three categories

3) Check which category has larger S/sqrt(B)

4) This defines our final categorization

5) Now run again the analysis, this time exclusively, using the
categorization as determine above

6) Combine the results to obtain the final value of the signal
significance.
