* JR working in the various sections of the paper

* For the paper plots, produce the various kinematical distributions
before b-tagging to avoid losing too much statistics

* JF checked that we don't really gain signal significance if we try
to b-tag the three hardest subjets instead of only the two hardest
subjets, which is our baseline

* KB to check that the reweighted vs no reweighted analysis give
identical results - to avoid problems with statistics, suggested
to run a special analysis with much looser kinematical cuts

* JF to check why if the b-tagging efficiency is increased
the signal significance drops - might be related to statistics,
so perhaps we need to recheck using the reweighting analysis

* One can try to check reweighted vs no reweighted in the signal
and in the dominant backgrounds only - 2b2j should be fine, and if
there is any problem, we should be able to spot it from there.

* The MVA for the boosted case shows a really nice improvement
in the discrimination power where substructure variables, including
splitting scales and subjetiness, are included in the analysis.

* In the boosted case only, after including substructure variables in
the MVA, we can achieve a signal significance S/sqrt(B) of almost 2

* Agreed to check that is the signal significance of only the 4b background
is used (as all other groups do). Also agree to check the numbers
for 300 1/fb

* We can still gain a bit by increasing the pt cut in the subjets
in the boosted case

* Now that our settings are final, we agreed to run an exclusive
analysis with the following categorization

Boosted -> Intemediate -> Resolved

so that we can combine the significance of the three channels
into a single figure of merit

* NH will take care of running this exclusive analysis and then
feeding the results into the MVA

* Try also this with the increase in the cut of the subjets
from 15 GeV to 40 GeV

* KB will investigate the effect of using the variable R jets
in the analysis

* Consensus that for the final results we are fine with parton
level results before hadronization, since this will not have any impact
on the physics conclusions and would require to change completely
all the b-tagging strategy, with unpredictable consequences.

* In any case NH will launch the generation of the samples
with hadronization, that CI needs to a related project
