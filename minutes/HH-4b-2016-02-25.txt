HH4b meeting

********************************************

* Redo at 14 TeV the same plots that at 100 TeV
Cut flows, including after MVA, as well as chi2
plots after the MVA
Circulate them for discussion at the next meeting

* Agreed to plot a number of signal kinematic variables
as a function of the Higgs trilinear
Agreed to post them in the live Indico page that CI has set up
https://indico.cern.ch/event/503791/

* Need to understand how to compute the systematic uncertainties
in the extraction of the self coupling
The first thing to understand is the error on the classification

* JF suggests to optimise analysis for different lambda
for instance with subjet pt related to b-tagging
For this we need the different kinematic distributions as a function
of the self-coupling

* Agreed to prepare for next week, each of us, a detailed proposal
of how we would perform the measurement of the trilinear
and to assign systematic uncertainties
We can link this to the live page
CI in particular will prepare a flow chart


* Agreed to generate higher stats for 4b, 2b2j and 4j
30M events, running in the NNPDF server
This will help in some of our problems with statistics-limited background

* Need sidebands to normalize backgrounds
Use the region outside the Higgs mass window to normalize the backgrounds?
We need to define control regions to train the MVA

* KB has determined some additional backgrounds, as requested
by Daniela
Agreed to process them though our analysis to see how they
compare with the QCD backgrounds.


* Estimate systematics in the MVA classification
i) Generate background samples for different muR and muF, we
can use HT/2 and 2HT instead of our current default
which is HT
ii) Use a different MC generator for the background
events
In particular, since we already have matrix-element events
with Sherpa, agreed to shower them with Pythia and check
how this affects the MVA classification

* NH will check the statistical uncertainties associated
to the MVA classification by means to the bootstrap method.
