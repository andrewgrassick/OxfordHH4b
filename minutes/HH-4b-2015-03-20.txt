Summary of our meeting today:

* The next meeting is *Monday 4th May 10.00am*

* The cut ptb > 15 GeV for b tagged quarks is really useful to kill the
background by an order of magnitude, so we decide to use it as baseline
from now on

* Selecting first the leading jets and performing the b-tagging only on
those is also very efficient to suppress the backgrounds by a factor 10,
so we adopt this as baseline: after selecting the leading 4/3/2 jets
(for each of the cathegories) we throw away the rest of the event

* Agreed to move the Higgs mass window (C3) to C1

* After C1, we will run the MVA on signal and background events: this
will allow to use all the discriminatory power from the MVA without
having to deal with the problem of very low statistics

* After the MVA, we will have the b-tagging step as we have now

* In C1 we might want to add some extra loose angular cuts to improve
the purity of the sample before the MVA training

* Concerning smearing, we agreed to smear all particles before the jet
clustering (assumed to be massless) and keep constant the angles, and
smear only the energy by 5%

* For next week, add S/B and S/sqrt(B) for all the tables, and also
include the numbers with the explicit decomposition of the background

* This new strategy should be very close to the final setup. With the
current, non-optimized selection we have S/sqrt(B)=0.9, so with the MVA
etc we should be able to improve substantially

* The most promising channel in terms of S/Sqrt(B) is the intermediate
regime. This suggests to use it as baseline, and then at the end make
the boosted and resolved categories exclusive to increase  a bit the
statistical significance of the resolved category.

* The aim for next Monday is to update the results of today with the
final strategy, including the MVA before the b-tagging.

* Cigdem will look up what the energy resolution for clusters is as function
* of their pt or energy.

* Cigdem will also look up what the Higgs mass resolution for future HL-LHC
* runs is expected to be.
