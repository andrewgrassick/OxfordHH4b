Minutes of 2H4b meeting on the 04.05.2015

1) Nathan, Katharina and James came to the conclusion that the strategy we had
agreed at our last meeting to run the MVA before b-tagging is applied is not a
good route to go, because the MVA would be trained such that it would try to
get rid of the 4j background and would ignore the lower statistics
backgrounds: 2j2b and 4b. And when we add b-tagging to the event selection we
would be left with nearly no 4j background but a large fraction of 2j2b and 4b
backgrounds. 

--> While writing these minutes I thought we could actually train the MVA on
signal and only the 4b and 2b2j samples. Leave out the 4j background which
will be dramatically reduced when adding b-tagging anyway. 

Train the MVA on 2b2j and 4b and signal. 

Run MVA on the full backgrounds and signal. 
Add b-tagging afterwards. 
<--- end of suggestion. 

2) They decided instead weight the events according to their b-tagging and
fake probabilities. 
In order to do this they had to pt-order the sub-jets and used the two leading
b-tagged sub-jets. 
For the case WITH pt-ordering the reweighted and unreweighted analysis agree
reasonably well (pending addition of uncertainties in James' macro):

reweighted S/sqrt(B) = 0.404
unreweighted S/sqrt(B) = 0.417

Compared to the case WITHOUT pt-ordering, this is a reduction of roughly 30%
(The value we calculated during the meeting last week was 0.6 but Nathan
should correct us here). This needs to be taken with a grain of salt as the
two results WITHOUT pt-ordering have only been derived using the unreweighted
case which suffers from very low statistics, especially in the 4j background.

We spent a lot of time discussing this, since the ATLAS boosted 2H4b analysis
in https://cds.cern.ch/record/1741546/files/ATL-COM-PHYS-2014-785.pdf which
used the two leading b-tagged subjets sees a better performance in comparison
to using any b-tagged subjet, see appendix. 

3) We decided that we should look at the different number of background events
selected in the each background sample for a)when the two leading b-tagged
sub-jets are used and for b) when any two b-tagged sub-jets are used. For this
comparison the weight calculation needs to change and we discussed this and
the team has an idea how to compute the combinatoric. 

4) We also agreed that the tables with numbers should have errors included for
the S/B and S/sqrtB. 

5) Daniela would like to meet Wednesday's at 10:00 and all of us who were
present are ok with this. We need feedback from Juan on this. 

6) We also agreed that we will put the minutes also into the GitHub
repository. Katharina has agreed to take of this.
