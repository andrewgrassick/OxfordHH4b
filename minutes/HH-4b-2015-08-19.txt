Detector simulation
-------------------

- Agreed to simulate finite angular resolution of calorimeter
towers by having a finite granularity of 0.1 \times 0.1
in the rapidity/azimuth plane

- Agreed to then smear the pt of individual final state particles,
and apply mass shell condition to the calorimeter towers

- A 5% value of Et of the towers seems to be a bit
too optimistic, agreed to change the working point to 7.5%,
and then try other values.

- If more refined treatment is needed, we can study a pt
dependence of this smearing factor, but this should not
be needed

- Once this is done, we agree that this is a reasonable enough
simulation of detector effects

Pile-up simulation
------------------

- Let's begin adding 50 minbias events to each hard event

- We have 3M events for each background samples, assuming that
we can reuse PU events at most 10 times, we need to generate

4 backgronds * 3M events per sample = 12 M back events

12 M back events * 50 pu per event = 600M minbias events

 600M minbias events / reuse 10 times = 60M min bias events needed

- NH has generated 3M, this is very quick, so he can generate a factor
20 more without much problem

- Then agreed to use SoftKiller at the particle level (after the shower,
but before we generate the calorimenter towers) to remove
the PU effects, using the FastJet routines and the default
parameters of their paper
