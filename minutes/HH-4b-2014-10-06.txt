Minutes meeting 2014/10/06
---------------------------

* Add the possibility to replace fixed R jet clustering
with the  variable R algorithm
Check the improvement in signal efficiency and background rejection

* The parameters that Katharina derived for Higgs jets are
rho = 500 GeV, Rmax = 1.0, Rmin = 0.2 

* For b-tagging in the boosted regime, using tracking
b tagger one can separate b quarks down to DeltaR = 0.05

* Try b tagging with variable R jets, using small Rmin,
this simulates how we we can do b tagging in the boosted regime

* Can we improve the fake mistag rates? Can we go below 1%?
This could be a limiting factor of the analysis

* To tag  a b quark, its pt should be larger than 25 or 30 GeV

* We agreed to plot the pt spectrum of the b jets from the
Higgs decays
leading, subleading etc

* Add in the cut flow the numbers that quantify the
effect of b tag both for signal and for background

* To improve separation of signal and background, we agreed
to use a home-made discriminant based on artificial neural networks,
which we can validate with ROOT's TMVA.

For this, the code will output the ntuples that then can be 
fed into the ANNs

ANN should be a able also to determine which of the kinematical
variables are more relevant

* We agreed that JR implements in the code the modifications above,
and then we create N branches in GitHub (Nathan, Katharina) to be able
to develop the code in parallel but then easily be able to merge back.

* The plan is that by next week we have all the code installed
and running, and we can begin assessing the impact of various 
analysis strategies.
