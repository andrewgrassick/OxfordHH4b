A summary of what we discussed today.

We agreed to concentrate a bit more on the efficiency plots for the signal at
parton level. Nathan and James will work on polishing the plot, including
generating more signal events to improve the stats and to use the correct
definition of the statistical uncertainty. Also we agreed that for the crucial
plots the style should be publication like, with all labels correct, the
legends etc, else it is difficult to understand the plots

We also agreed to add also the semi-boosted category, and to provide an extra
curve for the total efficiency adding the three categories with some
priorization criterion, for example boosted -> semiboosted -> resolved.

We also agreed to check up to which Higgs pt we expect signal events at the
HL-LHC, and cut the plots where the number of expected signal events drops
below one.

Cigdem emphasized the importance of producing a number of crucial plots at
truth level, she will send an email with the list of these plots, that we
should produce by the meeting next Friday.

Once we are completely sure that the parton level efficiency plots is fully
kosher and we are all happy with the result, we will add first parton shower
and then the background, but at least we will have a well defined and
controlled procedure.

So in summary, the crucial priority now is to wrap up the truth-level studies,
including the efficiency plot (at the final level of the analysis, including
efficiencies, mass-drop-tagger efficiencies etc) and with the complete
categorization including the semi-boosted category.
