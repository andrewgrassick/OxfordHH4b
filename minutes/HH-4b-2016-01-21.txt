* Agreed to submit to EPJC
JR will email the JHEP editors to complain about their decision

* Agreed that NH will first of include all the code fixes
(such as include H->bb branching fraction at the same level as
the C-factors) before running any fits

Before any of these modifications are done, we will tag the code to
ensure that the code used to produce the results of the
paper is fully reproducible

* For next week, NH will produce a plot of sigma(lambda) as a function
of lambda after the MVA, both combining the three categories
and separately for the three categories.
The MVA will be trained only on the SM sample

* Agreed to dump the 4j background from now on, we don't really
have statistical control over that. So in these jobs that NH
will run we will include only the 2b2j and 4b background, and no
PU for the time being

* Discussed the strategy to extract the Higgs trilinear. The idea
is to construct a chi2 estimator

chi2 = ( sigma(lam) - sigma(lam_SM))^2/Total_Error^2

where of course the tricky part is how to extract the total error.

* To begin with we can assume that the total error is statistical,
and is thus given by 1/sqrt(N), with N the total number of events.

If we look at the numbers in the paper, we find that

sigma_stat = 6% (boosted)

sigma_stat = 9% (intermediate)

sigma_stat = 4% (resolved)

If the three categories are combined, the total stat error is 3%.

* The real question is to assess how the systematic uncertainties
in the measurement affect the MVA training. We agreed to try the
NNPDF method

- Start from the MC distributions, as truth

- Estimate the statistical and systematic errors for each distribution
(like the pt_Higgs), and their correlation

- Generate MC replicas with this information, and train an MVA
on each of these

The envelope of the results of the MVA replicas will determine which
is the uncertainty in the MVA classification factor due to
experimental uncertainties

- Here we can use very similar code as the one in NNPDF

- To train the background, and normalize to the "data", we can
impose a cut mH < 115 GeV or mh > 135 GeV, to elliminate the
contribution from the signal.

Conferences: Cigdem will submit abstracts to ICHEP and LHCP, we can
decide the speaker later. Juan will to do the AMVA4NP network meeting
and Nathan to DIS2016.
