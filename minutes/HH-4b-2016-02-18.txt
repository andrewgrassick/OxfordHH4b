1) Update on the analysis for different values of lambda at 14 TeV, including MVA training (Nathan)

=> 

2) First studies on the extraction of the trilinear coupling (Nathan)

3) Implementation of the new variables: color flow and angular variables (Katharina)

4) Tests of the new on-the-fly implementation of PU (Katharina+Nathan)

5) Contribution to the FCC100 Higgs Report (Juan)

For the latter item, I attach a very first rough draft of our contribution. The deadline is really close (end of next week at the latest) but I think it should be enough to provide a first order-of-magnitude estimate of the situation for the 100 TeV collider (as opposed to the 14 TeV case, where we want to be really careful).



* Benchmark succesful

* Delete MB events

* Drop the 4j events

* Keep the same cuts as in the published paper

* Add post-MVA numbers

=> Merge trunk and

* Plots also at 14 TeV

* Extra backgrounds

* NH add numbers to git

* Implementation of new variables

color flow and chi
