===========================================================

Agreed to move the HH4b meeting to Tuesdays 10am, as usual in the Dalitz
discussion area
 
Action Items for the Analyzers to be implemented by today such that we can
look at them on Tuesday:

    1.  Right now our signal/background ratio is tiny, but we should improve  this by
	1. 	Imposing a cut in the pt of the b quarks/hadrons one is tagging,
		between 5 and 15 GeV, to remove the soft hadrons from the parton shower (this
		cut is missing in the results shown today)
        2.	Doing b-tagging not a la UCL, but first selecting a small subset of
		jets and then b-tagging (but keep the UCL numbers for comparison). 
    2.	We should redo the simulation including the smearing, for loose cuts this
	should have no effect but it is crucial for the MVA 

Things the analyzers should implement in the next week:

    1.	Agreed to compare the results of single vs double b-tagging in the boosted
	category.
        1.	leading jet double b-tagged, sub-leading only one b-tagged
        2.	leanding and subleading single b-tagged
        3.	leading jet double b-tagged and not b-tagging on the subleading
    2. 	Using the MVA (these plots we should look at ones we have a better
		understanding of the baseline selection). 
    3.	We need to study the S/B and S/sqrtB dependency on b-tagging efficieny,
	fake-rate reduction efficiency, signal selection efficiency, mass resolution,
	uncertainty on background. This would be the content of chapter 4 of the
	paper.
    4. 	Agreed to produce a set of paper-quality plots for all the kinematic
   	variables that enter the cut-flow


Action item for Cigdem: A paper in latex has been setup in the github
repository by Juan. We need to stress the crucial points of our study: the
role of fakes, the combined approach boosted+resolved, the MVA;

    1. Cigdem will move from doc to tex.
    2. She will have a parts of the introduction or selection section.
