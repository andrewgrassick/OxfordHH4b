***********************************************************

* Finalise the small corrections needed in the b-tagging

* Implement c-tagging with charm mistag probability of 10%

* Smearing: agreed to smear only the magnitude of the four-momentum
but not its direction

E -> E' = ( 1 + sigmaE ) * E

\vec{p} -> \vec{p'} =  ( 1 + sigmaE ) * \vec{p}

with sigmaE a gaussianly distributed random number, with STD
currently set to 5%

* Before tagging the code, check that the unweighted and
the two reweighted analysis all give identical results
within statistics
For this test, it might be useful to loosen the kinemtical
cuts to increase the statistics

* Run the final analysis code on parton level samples,
to understand why fakes are so important

* Correct the overlap plot in the paper with the correct weights

* Add the missing kinematic information to the n-tuples

* Tag the code before running any of the analysis variations
and produce the final numbers

* The MVA will be retrained for each of the analysis variations
