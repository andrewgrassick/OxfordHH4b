- NH produced plots of Nev for S and B as a function of
NN discriminant

- We agree that we can cut relatively hard in the discriminant
to maximize significance and still get a large enough number
of events. if we cut around 0.9 the significance is above 3 and the
number of S events is around 100, which looks very good

- These plots will go into the paper, since it shows how
smooth the response of the MVA is

- Agreed to cross-check some of NH plots with the numbers
in the analysis cut-flow

- If we only have the 4b background, the resolved and intermediate
cases improve a lot, but the boosted stays more or less the same.
This is good news, since it implies that the most important
channel is not dramatically affected by the modeling of the fakes

- JF's checks show that moving fb from 80% to 90% has the expected
results except for 2b2j and 4j backgrounds in the boosted case,
where the number of events increases much more than it should.
We know that

S/sqrt(B)

should scale as fb^2, and this is more or less what we see except
in this case.

- Need to understand this problem with highest priority, since
it could indicate a bug in the analysis code

- Variable R are not really helpful, since the Higgs bosons are produced
in a relatively narrow range of pt. So they will not be
included in the final strategy

- Agreed to produce a repository of plots to be able
to write the paper, together data files and plotting scripts
to be able to change the labels etc. This should be done before
we can manage to begin to write the paper.
