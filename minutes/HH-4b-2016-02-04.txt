Meeting 2016/02/04
-------------------

* NH has completed the code "plumbing", including the fact that
now PU is generated on the fly, rather than separately from the analysis,
which allows to save a lot of disk space

* Found bug with the implementation of the subjetiness ratio,
which is moreover compiler dependent -> to be investigated

* NH produced the first results for the runs with variations of the
higgs self-coupling -> The pre-MVA higgs cross-section as a function
of lambda, for various steps of the cut-flow

* Agree to plot the efficiency of each step of the cut flow as a function
of the value of the self-coupling

* Understand what factors determine the efficiency as a function
of the self-coupling
=> Agreed to plot various differential distributions, like the Higgs pt
or the subjet pt distribution, as a function of different values
of lambda

* NH will now process the results through the MVA, so that we can
also use the post-MVA cross-sections

* Agreed to rethink about the category priorisation, maybe now it
is more advantageous to prioritize the resolved rather than the boosted
category

* Agreed to generate background samples for additional processes,
such as Zh->4b, as suggested by DB

* Based on these results, JR will perform a first extraction of lambda
using a chi2 function and assuming only the statistical uncertainties.
This will be done separately for various stages of the pre-MVA cut-flow and
then for the post-MVA results.

* This will provide an upper limit on the accuracy that we can aim for
the extraction of the Higgs self coupling for different values
of the integrated luminosity

* CG suggest to add angular variables to the MVA, such as dijet angular
variables, which might help in increase the significance of the
self-coupling. KB and NH will take care of this in the code.
Similarly for color flow variables.

* The role of the angular variables will differ between the categories.
