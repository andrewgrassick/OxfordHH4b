\section{Robustness under realistic pile-up conditions}

\label{sec:pileup}

The discussion so far has not included the effects of
pile-up, under realistic conditions of the HL-LHC.

In this section we show how our qualitative results, in particular
the enhanced discrimination provided by the MVA, are robust
even when realistic pile-up conditions are accounted for.
