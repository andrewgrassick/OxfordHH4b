Dear Cigdem, Juan,

Regarding the mass resolution, I was wondering whether we should also give the equivalent of Table 2 for the boosted case (new version attached).

Based on these results, I am wondering how to interpret the weights for m_H0 and m_H1 in Figures 19 (no PU) and 23 (PU80+SK):

For the resolved case, the weights are almost unchanged, despite the slight worsening of the resolution.

For the boosted case, on the other hand, the importance of m_H0 and m_H1 is reduced if PU is added.

Obviously, the large-R jet mass is more susceptible to PU than the mass in the reconstructed case which mostly depends on the angle between jets.

Should we comment on this?

A couple of minor comments on Table 2:

- It might be worth quoting errors for the mass resolution values as these are clearly not significant, e.g. PU80 no SK yields a 9 GeV resolution for H0, whereas the resolution is 11 GeV if SK is applied. Physics-wise, we would expect the opposite so this is probably limited by the fit precision.

- I found the column label "dm_h" a bit confusing as I needed to look for the definition. I would replace it by "m_h^{reco} - 126 GeV". This is more explicit.

Hi Juan,

Oh, sorry, your are right: 125 GeV is indeed the value we use in the code.

A few more comments on the new draft - more specifically on all figures and tables - below.

Best,

Katharina


Figure 1: Swap plots or correct caption (triangle diagram is the one on the right)

Table 1: We have 1M signal events now.

Caption of Table 1:
- "samples using" --> "samples used"
- "provide in each case" --> "The corresponding inclusive K-factors... are also given." (drop "in each case")

Caption of Figure 2:
- "(left/right plot)" --> "(left/right)". Same in the captions of all the following figures.
- "in in" --> "in"
- Mention explicitly that ALL background components are used (since we also quote numbers for 4b only)

Figure 3:
- Put n_PU in brackets as in Figure 2. Fix this also in all the following figures.
- Why are we showing only the distributions for the subleading large-R jet?

Caption of Figure 3:
- AKT03 --> anti-kT ... (as in the main text)

Figure 7:
- "same as Fig. 6" --> shouldn't this say "same as Fig. 2" or is this intended as you are now referring to the di-Higgs system?

Figure 8:
- "no PU" --> "<n_PU> = 0" (same notation as in previous figures)
- Why is tau_21 shown for subleading Higgs but the others are not?

Caption of Figure 8:
- Split last sentence. "... for the leading Higgs. In the case of \tau_{21}, the distributions for the subleading Higgs are also given."

Figure 9 and all following:
- Legend: "no PU" --> "<n_PU> = 0" (same notation as in previous figures)

Caption of Figure 9:
- "now with SK subtraction" --> "now using \texttt{SoftKiller} (SK) for PU subtraction"

Table 2:
- "no PU" --> "<n_PU> = 0" (same notation as in previous figures)
- see further comments in my previous e-mail

Caption of Table 3:
- "cut-flow levels" (too colloquial) --> "selection criteria at different stages in the cut-based analysis" or something similar (maybe ask James/Nathan)

Caption of Table 4:
- adapt according to changes in caption of Table 3

Figure 15:
- Legend: "no PU" --> "<n_PU> = 0" (same notation as in previous figures)

Caption of Figure 16:
- "and black smaller" --> "and black indicating smaller"

Figure 19:
- Is the boosted plot bigger on purpose?

Caption of Table 6:
- "We indicate" --> "We quote"

Captions of Figure 21 and 22 and 23:
- "SK subtraction" --> "using \texttt{SoftKiller} (SK) for PU subtraction"

- "pre-MVA results corresponds" --> "pre-MVA results correspond" (plural)

Dear Juan, 
would it be possible to add to table 5 and table 7 the number of background events for just the 4b backgrounds and also the corresponding S/sqrt(B) and S/B values for this scenario. It would be good to have these also for the MVA analysis in order to have a feel by how much we could gain in significance if we could get the fake backgrounds under control....

Hi Juan
I have read the paper on flight from LA to NYC. It is really good but I still have many comments on the text. 
There are a few thing that are not defined or clear in a few places.
 I have put all of my comments in the  annotated the PDF file, which I attach
A couple of general comments on the  Figures:
1) the layout with the grid is not really good for a publication in my opinion.
2) Figures 13 and 14 showing the background and the signal with PU and PU +SK are very busy. Since the figures are really to show that even with PU we are able to maintain discrimination between S and B when we apply SK, I was wondering if it would be better to remove the lines showing the background and signal without PU. I think the simpler plots would make the point more clearly.

It would be great if Nathan (and James) if he is available could go over the final text before we submit.
    Best wsihes
