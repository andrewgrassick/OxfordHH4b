\label{sec:analysis}

Describe the 3 different kinematic regimes: resolved, semi-boosted and boosted and selection cuts. Show table with numbers. How often do events end up in these categories.

Table 1: how many events we see from Signal and background in each category. Indicate also the overlap between the categories. This table should have also the S/B and S/sqrtB numbers. We need also the S/B and S/sqrtB numbers without the 2b2j and 4j backgrounds in order to compare with the UCL paper in this table.

Figure 1: Higgs pt, eta distributions

Figure 2: b-jet pt distributions

Figure 3: delta R distributions

Figure 4: mass distributions

Table 2: S/B and S/sqrtB table with
All these figures should have the backgrounds overlaid.

This section would show that the 2b2j and 4j backgrounds are important and that control of the fakes is necessary.

This section should also identify which of the different regimes is the most important for the measurement.
