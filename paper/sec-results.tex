\section{Results}

\label{sec:results}

Study S/B, S/sqrt B vs b-tagging efficiency, background rejection and signal efficiency

This section would show how S/B is correlated with the different efficiencies. It would give the reader a feel for which of these sources the analysers would need to attack to make the 4b channel a competitive channel with regard to other channels.
