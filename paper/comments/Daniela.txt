Hi Juan
I have read the paper and I have put my comments in the pdf file.
Very nice results. The strategy is very strong. I also think that the
finding that the fake rate is important and that the bbjj and jjjj
are not negligible is very useful information for the community.
In my opinion almost all the plots have to be re-done with large fonts .

Of course in this version some of the results are still missing.
In page 23 you state that you plan not to combine the results but then in
the conclusions you state that we  will combine them
I do think that even if the intermediate and resolved categories do not
add much...it is still better to combine them.

As you know both CMS and ATLAS plan to have tracking in the forward region
...would that add anything ? Or the events are in any case quite central ?
Do we have plots showing the contribution of the various background  ???

Best Daniela
