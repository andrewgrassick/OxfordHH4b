\section{Introduction}

The measurement of double Higgs production will be one of the main
physics goals of the LHC program in its recently started high-energy
phase, as well as for its future high-luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC),
which aims to accumulate a total integrated
luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$~\cite{ATLAS:2013hta,CMS:2013xfa}.
%
Higgs pair production is directly sensitive to the
Higgs trilinear coupling $\lambda$~\cite{baglio}, and thus 
provides crucial
information on the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism.
%
It is also sensitive to the underlying strength of the Higgs interactions
at high energies, and can be used to test the composite nature of the 
Higgs boson~\cite{Giudice:2007fh,Contino:2010mh}.
%
While Standard Model (SM) cross-sections are small,
many Beyond the SM (BSM)
scenarios predict enhanced rates for double Higgs production, and
thus searches for this process have already been performed by ATLAS and CMS with Run I data~\cite{Aad:2015uka,Aad:2014yja,Khachatryan:2015yea,Chatrchyan:2011wt}
and will continue at Run II.
%
In addition, Higgs pair production will also be a central process at
any future high-energy 
collider, either at a 100 TeV circular machine~\cite{Barr:2014sga,Papaefstathiou:2015iba,Azatov:2015oxa} or at
a linear or circular electron-positron collider~\cite{Contino:2013gna}.

As in the case of single Higgs production,
in the SM the dominant mechanism for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons at the LHC is 
gluon fusion (see Ref.~\cite{baglio,Frederix:2014hta} and references therein), analogously to single
Higgs production~\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}.
%
For a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 14\,$TeV, the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
total cross section is approximately $40\,$fb~\cite{deFlorian:2013jea},
which is increased by a further few percent once NNLL corrections
are accounted for~\cite{deFlorian:2015moa}.
%
Feasibility studies in the case of a SM-like Higgs boson
in gluon fusion have been performed for several different final states, including
$b\bar b\gamma\gamma$~\cite{Baur:2003gp,Barger:2013jfa},
$b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$~\cite{Baur:2003gpa,Barr:2013tda,Dolan:2012rv,Dolan:2013rja},
$b\bar{b}W^+W^-$~\cite{Dolan:2012rv,Papaefstathiou:2012qe} and
$b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$~\cite{Baur:2003gpa,Dolan:2012rv,Wardrope:2014kya,deLima:2014dta,Barger:2013jfa}.
%
While these studies differ in their qualitative conclusions,
a consistent picture emerges 
that the ultimate precision in the determination of the Higgs trilinear
coupling $\lambda$
will only be achieved from the combination of various final states.


In addition to the gluon-fusion production mode, Higgs pairs
can be also produced in the vector-boson fusion
channel $hhjj$~\cite{Contino:2010mh,Dolan:2013rja,Dolan:2015zja,
  Brooijmans:2014eja},
the associated production modes $hhW$ and $hhZ$~\cite{Barger:1988jk,baglio}
(also known as Higgs-Strahlung),
and also in association
with top quark pairs $hht\bar{t}$~\cite{Englert:2014uqa}.
%
All these channels are challenging due to the small production
rates: at 14 TeV, the inclusive total cross-sections are
2 fb for VBF $hhjj$~\cite{Liu-Sheng:2014gxa},
0.5 fb for $W(Z)hh$~\cite{baglio}
and 1.0 for $hht\bar{t}$~\cite{Englert:2014uqa}.
%
Concentrating on the SM dynamics of Higgs pair production
in different channels, several studies
have investigate the interplay of various kinematical
distributions towards the optimisation of the
extraction of $\lambda$ from the measured
cross-sections, as well as the improvement
in the signal modeling taking into account
higher-order corrections and theoretical
uncertainties~\cite{Slawinska:2014vpa,Chen:2014xra,Goertz:2013kp,
  Frederix:2014hta,Dawson:2015oha,Maltoni:2014eza,Maierhofer:2013sha,Grigo:2013rya,Grigo:2014jma}.
%


While the SM production rates for Higgs
pair production are small in all production modes,
and require the full integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC phase
to be accessed, double Higgs production rates can be substantially
enhanced in a variety of Beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios.
%
Feasibility studies of Higgs pair production in New Physics
models have been performed in a number of different frameworks,
including Effective Field
Theories (EFTs) with higher-dimensional
operators and anomalous values of the
Higgs couplings~\cite{Nishiwaki:2013cma,Dall'Osso:2015aia,Azatov:2015oxa,Liu:2014rba,Goertz:2014qta,He:2015spf,Grober:2015cwa}, resonant production
in models such as extra dimensions~\cite{Gouzevitch:2013qca,Cooper:2013kia,No:2013wsa}, as well as
in the context of Supersymmetry or Two Higgs Doublet models (2HDMs)~\cite{Belyaev:1999kk,Han:2013sga,Hespel:2014sla,Wu:2015nba,Cao:2014kya,Ellwanger:2013ova}.

%
In many of these scenarios, the production rates are enhanced
and Higgs pair production becomes accessible already at
Run II, while still being consistent with current limits on BSM searches
and single Higgs coupling measurements.
%
With this motivation, searches for the production of Higgs pair
have already been performed at Run I
by ATLAS in the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$~\cite{Aad:2015uka}
and $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$~\cite{Aad:2014yja} final states,
and by
CMS in the same $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$~\cite{Khachatryan:2015yea}
and $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011wt} final
states.
%
One should note that in general BSM dynamics modify substantially
the kinematic distributions of the Higgs decay products, for
instance boosting the di-Higgs system, and therefore
different analysis strategies would be requires in BSM
Higgs pair searches as compared to SM production measurements.

In the context of SM production,
the main advantage of the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ final state is the
enhancement of the signal yield
from the large branching fraction of Higgs bosons into bottom-anti-bottom
pairs, ${\rm BR}\lp H\to b\bar{b}\rp\simeq 0.57$~\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}.
%
However, a measurement in this channel
needs to deal with an overwhelming QCD multi-jet background.
%
Recent studies of Higgs pair production in this
final state~\cite{Wardrope:2014kya,deLima:2014dta}
estimate that, for an integrated
luminosity of
$\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}$=3000 fb$^{-1}$,
a signal significance of around $S/\sqrt{B}\sim 2.0$ could be obtained.
%
These studies are
based on exploiting the differences between signal and background
using techniques that account for a large number of kinematic
variables, Boosted Decision Trees
and Shower Deconstruction~\cite{Soper:2011cr} respectively.
%
While irreducible backgrounds, such as $4b$ and
$t\bar{t}$, are included, the contribution
from reducible processes, such as $bbjj$ and
$jjjj$, which can fake the signal when 
light jets are mistagged as $b$-jets, are not accounted for.
%
As will show, this approximation is not justified since, both due to
combinatorics and to $b$-quark radiation in the shower, the
contribution of the $2b2j$ and $4j$ backgrounds can become comparable or even larger
than the irreducible $4b$ component.

In this work, we revisit the feasibility of SM Higgs pair production by gluon-fusion
in the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ final state.
%
 Our strategy is based on a combination of traditional cut-based
 methods with modern multivariate analysis (MVA),
 leading to a substantial
  enhancement of the signal discrimination.
  %
  We account for  all relevant
  backgrounds, including the contribution from light jet fakes.
  %
  We also model the impact of the pile-up (PU) effects expected at the
  HL-LHC by means of modern PU subtraction techniques.
  %
  By combining the contribution from the boosted, intermediate and resolved
  topologies we achieve a total signal significance of $S/\sqrt{B}\simeq 4.0$
  for $\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}$=3000 fb$^{-1}$.
%
  These results emphasize the crucial importance that the $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ final state
  has for studies of Higgs pair production and for the determination of
  $\lambda$, as well as the advantages of the use of modern statistical
  analysis methods.
  
  
The structure of this paper is the following.
%
In Sect.~\ref{mcgeneration} we discuss the modeling of the signal
and background processes using Monte Carlo event generators.
%
In Sect.~\ref{sec:analysis}
we introduce our analysis strategy, and in particular
the classification of each individual event into
different categories according to their topology.
%
The results for the traditional cut-based analysis
are presented in Sect.~\ref{sec:results}, and in
Sect.~\ref{sec:mva} we show how we can enhance signal
significance using multivariate techniques.
%
The robustness of our results under realistic pile-up
conditions expected at the HL-LHC is illustrated in
 Sect.~\ref{sec:pileup}.
%
Finally, in Sect.~\ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude and outline
how our results can be extended to estimate the accuracy
in the determination of trilinear coupling $\lambda$ and the constraints on
BSM scenarios.
