\section{Introduction}

Describe the importance of the 2H channel and its connection to the self-coupling.
Stress the importance of self-coupling measurement and refer to previous studies which estimated the amount data needed for when this will be possible at the LHC.
Discuss the different decay channels of the Higgs and point to the fact that given the fact how low the SM di-Higgs cross section is that the 4b channels would give rates which would be by factors of xx larger than the other channels.
But previous studies show that xx fb-1 are needed due to the high backgrounds.
We refer to UCL paper and its results and say that our studies point to the fact that fake rate from the 2b2j and 4j background are not negligible. We have studied this and will present ways to mitigate this impact and present also new techniques to analyse this channel which improve the signal to background ratio.



The measurement of double Higgs production will be one of the main
physics goals of the LHC program in its upcoming high-energy and high-luminosity phase, as
well as of the program of any future high-energy collider.
%
Double Higgs production is directly sensitive to the Higgs trilinear coupling, and thus 
provides information on the scalar potential responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking.
It is also sensitive to the underlying strength of the Higgs interactions
at high energies, and can test the composite nature of the 
Higgs boson~\cite{Giudice:2007fh,Contino:2010mh}.


In the Standard Model (SM), the dominant mechanism for the production of two Higgs bosons at the LHC is 
gluon fusion (see Ref.~\cite{baglio} and references therein), analogously to single Higgs production.
For a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 14\,$TeV, the recently computed next-to-next to leading order (NNLO)
total cross section is approximately $40\,$fb~\cite{deFlorian:2013jea}.
%
Feasibility studies in the case of a light Higgs boson have been performed for several different final states, including
$b\bar b\gamma\gamma$~\cite{Baur:2003gp,Barger:2013jfa},
$b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$~\cite{Baur:2003gpa,Barr:2013tda,Dolan:2012rv,Dolan:2013rja},
$b\bar{b}W^+W^-$~\cite{Dolan:2012rv,Papaefstathiou:2012qe} and
$b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$~\cite{Baur:2003gpa,Dolan:2012rv,Gouzevitch:2013qca,Cooper:2013kia,Wardrope:2014kya,deLima:2014dta}.
