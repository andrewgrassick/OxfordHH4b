For each plot to be produced for the paper, please insert here a python script that generates
it from the source data.

Templates are prodided for matplotlib plots for basic histograms, ratio histograms, and 2-D histograms.
Templates are also present for the MVA plots.

The runAll.sh script loops through all scripts in this directory and executes them to produce the required
plots. At the end, all pdf files are copied to ../autoplots/.
