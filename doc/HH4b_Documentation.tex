\section{Introduction}


\section{Samples}

\section{Object and Event Selection}

\subsection{Resolved Topology}

The resolved selection requires the presence of at least four b-tagged anti-$k_T$ $R=0.4$ jets with $p_T >$25~GeV and $|\eta|>2.5$.
\textit{Pre-cut} histograms are written out for various kinematic distributions for all events with at least four b-tagged jets but before applying
further kinematic cuts. \textit{Post-cut} histograms contain only events where the four jets also pass the above kinematic cuts.

The di-Higgs system is reconstructed by considering all possibilities of forming two pairs of jets with invariant masses $m_{j1j2}$ and 
$m_{j3j4}$, respectively, and chosing the configuration that minimises their difference $|m_{j1j2} - m_{j3j4}|$. Only the four leading-$p_T$ jets
are considered here.

\subsection{Boosted Topology}\label{sec:Boosted_FR}

In the boosted topology, the decay products of each Higgs boson are merged into a single large-$R$ jet with a two-prong substructure. 
These Higgs jets are reconstructed as anti-$k_T$ $R=1.0$ jets for which two substructure variables, the first $k_T$ splitting scale $d_{12}$
and the 2-subjettiness ratio $\tau_{21}$, are calculated.
\textit{Pre-cut} histograms are written out after requiring the presence of at least two large-$R$ in the event but without applying any further
kinematic cuts. \textit{Post-cut} histograms are filled after the following additional cuts: 
Both jets are required to have $p_T >$100~GeV and $|\eta|>2.5$. Moreover, each jet is required to have at least two b-tagged anti-$k_T$ $R=0.3$ 
jets matched to it via \textit{ghost association}: 
To this end, the constituents of a given large-$R$ jet is reclustered using the jet algorithm 
and radius parameter of the original jet and so-called \textit{ghost jets}, each corresponding to a small-$R$ jet in the event, 
are added to the input for the cluster sequence. The 4-vector of a ghost jet is obtained from a given small-$R$ jet 
by setting its transverse momentum and mass to negligibly small values but retaining its direction in $\eta$ and $\phi$. A small-$R$ jet is 
considered matched to the large-$R$ jet if its ghost is found among the constituents of the reclustered jet. Ghost association allows to unambiguously
match small-$R$ to large-$R$ jets, even in dense environments where a simple matching based on the distance $\Delta R$ between jets 
may lead to multiple matchings.

\subsection{Boosted Topology with Variable-$R$ Jets}

The same selection as in Subsection~\ref{sec:Boosted_FR} is applied but this time using Variable-$R$ jets with the following parameters:
$\rho=500$~GeV, $R_{max}=$1.0, $R_{min}=$0.2.
