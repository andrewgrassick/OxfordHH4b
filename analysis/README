In this folder we have the main analysis code 

HH4b.cc

which takes a Les Houches parton level event file, showers it with
Pythia8 and then does the corresponding analysis, filling histograms,
creating plots etc.

It requires that you have installed:

* Pythia8 (I have tested up to v8.180):
http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia8/pythia8180.tgz

* Root

* Fastjet
http://fastjet.fr/

Here one also needs to install fastjet contrib
http://fastjet.hepforge.org/contrib/
to access the Variable R jets


* LHAPDFv5

The paths for these programs needs to be edited in the 
first of the Makefile. The rest of the Makefile should be
left untouched.

************************************

To run the code, you should edit in HH4b.cc

"string samples_path"

and set it to the path to the MC samples Dropbox folder
