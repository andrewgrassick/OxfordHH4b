REPLY TO THE EDITOR
************************************

We agree with the referee that it is worth explaining in the main body of the paper the additional studies that have been reported in our reply to his/her comments. To address this, in the revised version of the paper we have included two modifications:

* Added a short appendix with the discussion about single-Higgs backgrounds and showing that one can safely neglect them. We have also added a reference to this appendix when mentioning in the main text that single Higgs backgrounds can be neglected.

* In the results section, at the end of Sect. 5.3, we have added a new paragraph describing the tests that we have performed concerning the simulation of the multijet backgrounds, and added a word of caution concerning the low statistics of the 2b2j and 4j background.

We hope that having satisfactorily addressed all the points raised by the reference the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication in EPJC.
